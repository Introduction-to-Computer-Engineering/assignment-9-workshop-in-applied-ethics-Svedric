### Two main points

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.


### Answer the Questions

1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.

3. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?


### Class Activities
_Note: Class activities are group but individual submissions are required for grading._
 
1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:
   1. List the group members below.
   	Jorge T
   	Jesus CM
   	Bao H
   	Mustafa A
   	Logan P
   	Jackie W
   2. Pick a president and write their name below.
   	Logan P
   3. Describe your technical innovation below.
   	A virtual reality system accomplished using a brain-computer interface.
   
2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society. 
   1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed that
   	1. Lack of real world interaction: limit length of time users can use the system at once.
	2. Harm to body health: require users to meet an exercise quota.
	3. Hacking, glitches, etc: have the device perform a safe shutdown for user safety.
	4. Long-term effects on the brain: have users take breaks, spend more time in real life than virtual reality.
	5. Mental health: implement a computer program that serves as a therapist.
	6. Surrounding environment issues: notify users over danger detected around their body and detect health issues through the interface.
   2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: (i) immediately upon launch; (ii) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.
   	(i) Benefit of having an alternate reality to experience anything versus the detriment of keeping active and productive in reality
	(ii) Benefit of experiencing data in any way possible for research computation and simulation. Through this invention we greatly expand the capacity of human consciousness. The detriment is a shift in the way people experience and integrate the world. It is unsure at this point if this invention will be evolutionary or devolutionary for humans.
3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course? 
   1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.
   	Code of Ethics
	 i. Changes to this code of Ethics require a unanimous vote from all group members. This rule cannot be changed in any way. No rules may alter the function of this rule.
	 ii. All group members have equal joint governance over the product and updates to the hardware and software of the product require unanimous vote. No member may claim ownership over the product. This rule cannot be altered or affected in any way.
	 iii. No government shall have governance over our creation, barring prosecution for hacking offenses.
	 iv. Users must meet a standards-defined daily quota of exercise in the prior 24 hours to continue using the device.
	 v. Users must be 18 years of age in order to use the device.
	 vi. Private user data must be stored confidentially. It cannot be distributed or sold.
	 vii. A group member who violates this Code of Ethics is subject to immediate review by other group members preceding termination by unanimous vote. This rule cannot be changed or averted.
	 viii. The product may not cause harm to the user. This rule cannot be changed or averted in any way.
	 viiii. All following sub-groups concerning the technology are to follow the structure of this Code of Ethics. There shall be no exceptions to this rule. Any groups that violate this rule are subject to dissolution.
	 
4. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
   1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_


#### The Band
The derogatory expression _band of merry psychopaths_ is used in writing to refer to a small _group of irresponsible or deliberately hostile people with a lot of power_ to affect the world around them.
